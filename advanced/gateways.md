# Gateways

To provide our payment solutions and to ensure they're rock solid, we're employing the quite fantastic CI-Merchant libraries created by Adrian Macniel provides us with a solid base from which to build. Rather than reinventing the wheel we simply redeisgned the car around it - by using this library we modelled a slick system for integrating and choosing your required libraries as well as the settings you'd like to use for them all from within the administration panel.

### Included Gateways

We include a wide range of gateways, most of them have been included straight out of the ci-merchant core but a few additional ones have been created as part of production sites we have done, cleaned up and released as part of this package.

* 2Checkout
* Authorize.net
* DPS PXPay
* DPS PXPost
* Dummy
* Eway
* Eway Shared
* PayPal
* PayPal Payments Pro
* Sagepay Standard
* Sagepay IFrame
* Sagepay Hosted
* Stripe
* World Pay

### Additional Gateways

Adding additional gateways is very easy and we automatically detect the settings each merchant requires at installation. From there the form is automatically built and once a user adds their settings it will appear on the front end and be ready to use from the get-go.
